      <h1>Abiodun Obafemi.</h1>
      <p>Welcome to my portfolio!</p>
      <p>My name is Abiodun Obafemi and I’m a student at Kean University. 
          I just finished my freshman year, and I'm now heading into my sophomore year. 
          I was born in New Jersey, but I'm Nigerian.  
          I’m currently pursuing my Bachelor’s degree in computer science. 
          I would say I’m still a beginner to all of this but I do have coding experience in Java, Python, and HTML. 
          As a kid, I always played video games and thought it was cool how they were designed, which made me want to one day create my own. 
          I want to one day work as a software developer and develop games, apps, websites, etc.
